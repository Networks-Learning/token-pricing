One paragraph motivating the project. This can be, for example, the paper abstract.

## Dependencies

### python
All the experiments were performed using Python 3.9. In order to create a virtual environment and install the project dependencies you can run the following commands:

*The current `requirements.txt` contains commonly used packages. Remember to run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` before publishing the project.*

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Repository structure

```
├── data
├── figures
├── notebooks
├── outputs
│   ├── blah.txt
│   └── blah.json
├── scripts
│   └── blah.sh
└── src
    ├── blah.py
    └── utils.py
```

- `data` contains data and processed configuration files for our experiments.
- `figures` contains all the figures presented in the paper.
- `notebooks` contains python notebooks to generate all the figures included in the paper.
- `outputs` contains intermediate output files generated by the experiments' scripts.
- `scripts` contains a set of scripts used to run all the experiments presented in the paper. 
- `src` contains all the code necessary to reproduce the results in the paper. Specifically:
  - `blah.py` is a `python` file.
  - `utils.py` contains auxiliary functions for plotting.
